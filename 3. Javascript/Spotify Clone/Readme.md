Started the project by following along a tutorial,
but after some point , i  tried to get on my own and decided to do something cool , guess what happened next , a lot of bugs, after 4 to 5 hours of debugging and googling , my mind felt like mentally disturbed , so I thought it is enough for a basic javascript project 
The code looks clumsy , nevermind will get better some day . 


I am writing this here because some day I will come back here , and recall my journey of learning
